## Original Idea
> The name of this app will be the Human Principle. It will be focused on supervisors and their teams. Team members will post how they feel mentally, emotionally, and physically . Supervisors can see the information posted about each person, but team members can only see their own information. This app was inspired by the the current landscape of remote working.
